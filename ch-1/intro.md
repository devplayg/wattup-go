Go 언어는 Google에서 설계된 정적타입의 컴파일 언어입니다. 
2007년에 Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, Ken Thompson이 최소 설계를 시작했고, 
현재까지 다양한 개발자들이 참여하여 지속적으로 발전해오고 있습니다.

문법적으로 C와 비슷하지만, Memory safety, Garbage collection, Structural typing, CSP-Style

No VM
No classes
Not OOP

“Go has types and values rather than classes and objects.”

Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google[14] by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.[12]
 Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing,[6] and CSP-style concurrency.[15] 
 
 The language is often referred to as "Golang" because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.[16]

There are two major implementations:

Google's self-hosting[17] compiler toolchain targeting multiple operating systems, mobile devices,[18] and WebAssembly.[19]
gccgo, a GCC frontend.[20][21]
